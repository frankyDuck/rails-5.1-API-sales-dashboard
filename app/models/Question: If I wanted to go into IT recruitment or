Question: If I wanted to go into IT recruitment or something similar, how would a business see my previous years of experience as a developer using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Wordpress, servers, Ruby on Rails etc? 

The reason I ask is that I'm looking at moving to London and having a career change as I'm a people person and development doesn't really offer me that person to person interaction so I'm looking to see if my skills are transferable. I also worked as a street fundraiser in London for 6+ months so I have a sales background, I am just a bit rusty and would need some good training to get me up to scratch. 

Tag anyone who might be able to answer or any potential employers too that might be able to offer me an opportunity. 

Thanks! 

Ps - I self taught myself development from scratch to enable me to pay to live all over the world in places like Thailand, Greece, Spain, Poland.
